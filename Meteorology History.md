## NOAA history网站：“气象史是国家历史的一部分”

NOAA History is **an intrinsic part of the history of the United States** and the development of its science and commercial infrastructure.

The personnel of these organizations **served in peace and war **; worked in the remote and frontier regions of our Nation; and experienced rough seas, violent weather, various and sundary hardships in accomplishing their mission, and separation from family and friends. But through all of this they persevered with quiet courage and a fierce loyalty to their organization and the Nation.
